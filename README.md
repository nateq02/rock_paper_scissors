This is my rock, paper, scissors project. In this project, I worked to create a game that a user can play against a computer. The user chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly generates one of the 3 objects. The site keeps track of how many each party has won and alerts the user when either they or the computer win 5 rounds. This project allowed me to write some basic JavaScript functions, work with event listeners, as well as practice some of the CSS that I have learned.
